# VietnameseFestivalApp
a Vietnamese Festival Application

We, propose a festival information preservation framework that applied AI techniques to seek and exploit the festival knowledge in Vietnam. We also provide a Vietnamese festival lightweight ontology. We investigate and implement a practical application for identifying and mining the Vietnamese festival knowledge in Mekong Delta for the first work. Our initial approach concentrates on providing a web application that classifies the snapshot and automatically answers questions.
